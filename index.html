    <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>My name is Belen Fernandez. I was born on November 22nd, 1996. I'm from Argentina, I moved to Texas when I was 14 years old and been living there since then. I consider myself a very artistic person, I love drawing and painting so much and I love coding and the idea of creating things that are actually useful to many people. I also love to travel so much, it's my biggest passion of all, I've been to a couple of countries. I've been to Spain, France, Mexico, Italy and also went a couple of times to Argentina to visit my family. I love animals. I have 2 pets, a cat named Sam and a guinea pig named Fluffy. I also love fitness, it just makes me feel so good and healthy. Like I've always said, The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a personâ€™s determination. I'm determined to change everything for good in my life and always stay motivated and passionate.</p>   </p>
